- **News Ingestion Management Command (`ingest_news`)**
  - Created a robust, idempotent management command (`ingest_news`) within the `news` app to fetch articles from RSS feeds.
  - Implemented a file-based lock to prevent concurrent runs, ensuring safe execution.
  - Added logic to automatically seed the `Source` table from the `FEEDS` list in `settings.py`.

Contributor: John Akujobi

### Added

- **Django app `news`** wired into project via `news.apps.NewsConfig`.
- **Data model** (SQLite-friendly):
  - `Source`: external feed/source registry (enable/disable).
  - `Article`: normalized item with summary/snippet, image URL, timestamps, tags/keywords (JSON stored as TEXT), and **dedup `hash`**.
  - `UserProfile`: 1:1 with user; holds **tier** (`free|standard|premium`).
  - `ReadEvent`: per-day metering for logged-in users with **UNIQUE (user, article, date)**.
- **Signals**: auto-create `UserProfile(tier="free")` on user creation.
- **Admin**:
  - List, search, and filter for `Source`, `Article`, `ReadEvent`, `UserProfile`.
  - Tier bulk actions (set FREE/STANDARD/PREMIUM).
  - Inline `UserProfile` on Django User admin.
- **Settings** additions:
  - `TIME_ZONE="America/Chicago"` (local day boundary for metering).
  - **Feeds** list (`FEEDS`) seeded with 5 tech RSS URLs.
  - Metering/refresh knobs in code:`ANON_READS_PER_DAY=3`, `FREE_READS_PER_DAY=5`, `STANDARD_READS_PER_DAY=11`,`TTL_MINUTES=10`, `LAZY_REFRESH=True`,plus `FETCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=5`, `MAX_SEARCH_RESULTS=50`.
